Responsive design

Media queries: This tells the browser how to style an element at a particular viewport dimensions. It allow us tag it element on a webpage and style them differently at different viewport width.

Viewport meta tag: This allows us to tell the browser what width the viewport should be and if we zoom in or out.

A use experience is going to differ a lot on a mobile than desktop, so we need to make sure we make design decisions to relect that

Also designs should be planned for mobile design first and adapt them to a large screen because mobile screens are much more smaller so it helps us priortize the nesscary stuffs and it also makes our job much easier.
